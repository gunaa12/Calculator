# Calculator

## Summary

This is a Java app that players can use to perform simple calculations. This further reinforces my skills in Object Oriented Programming, threading, and GUI's through the use of Java's AWT and Swing framework. Also helped me learn event handling through clicks and so on.

## To access the code

1) Download the code by pressing on "Code" and then the "Download ZIP" button.
2) Extract the zip file an open the files in an IDE of your choice.
3) You now have full access (in addition to viewing, you can run the code as well) to all of the code.
